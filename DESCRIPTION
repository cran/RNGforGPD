Description: Generation of univariate and multivariate data that follow the generalized 
  Poisson distribution. The details of the univariate part are explained in 
  Demirtas (2017) <doi: 10.1080/03610918.2014.968725>, and the multivariate part is 
  an extension of the correlated Poisson data generation routine that was introduced in 
  Yahav and Shmueli (2012) <doi: 10.1002/asmb.901>.
